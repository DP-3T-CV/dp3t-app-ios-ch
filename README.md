## DP^3T
The Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) project is an open protocol for COVID-19 proximity tracing using Bluetooth Low Energy functionality on mobile devices that ensures personal data and computation stays entirely on an individual's phone. It was produced by a core team of over 25 scientists and academic researchers from across Europe. It has also been scrutinized and improved by the wider community.

DP^3T is a free-standing effort started at EPFL and ETHZ that produced this protocol and that is implementing it in an open-sourced app and server.

## Introduction
This is a COVID-19 tracing client using the [DP3T iOS SDK](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-ios). This project was released as the released as the official COVID-19 tracing solution for Switzerland, therefore UX, messages and flows are optimized for this specific case. Nevertheless, the source code should be a solid foundation to build a similar app for other countries and demostrate how the SDK can be used in a real app. The app design, UX and implementation was done by [Ubique](https://www.ubique.ch?app=github).

## Further Documentation
The full set of documents for DP3T is at https://github.com/DP-3T/documents. Please refer to the technical documents and whitepapers for a description of the implementation.

A description of the usage of the Apple Exposure Notifcation API can be found [here](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-ios/blob/master/EXPOSURE_NOTIFICATION_API_USAGE.md).


## Installation and Building

The project should be opened with the Xcode 11.7 or newer. Dependencies are managed with [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager), no further setup is needed.

### Provisioning

The project is configured for a specific provisioning profile. To install the app on your own device, you will have to update the settings using your own provisioning profile.

Apple's ExposureNotification Framework requires an entitlement (`com.apple.developer.exposure-notification`) that is only be available to public health authorities. You will find more information in the [Exposure Notification Addendum](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/Exposure_Notification_Addendum.pdf) and you can request the entitlement [here](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/exposure-notification-entitlement).
